# Path of Exile Chat Notifier
A small program to notify you if chosen keywords appear in chat.

- Choose your "Client.txt" located in the Path of Exile game folder via the "File" menu.
- Then put in some keywords that you want to get notified at when they appear in chat.
- Keywords are comma separated.
- Click "Start".
- Join the channel that you want to monitor. like: /global 820
- This works for all channels, including guild chat and trade chat.
- Note that item links won't work and never will :(
